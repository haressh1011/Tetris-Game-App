<h1>Project Title – Developed & Deployed Tetris Game App Using Azure Services & Created Docker Image.</h1>

<h2>Project Statement</h2>

The project aims to develop and deploy a Tetris game app using Azure services and Docker technology.
It addresses the common issue of managing dependencies by packaging all necessary components within a Docker image.
This project falls under the Lifestyle industry, providing entertainment and leisure for users.
The primary Azure technologies employed are Virtual Machines, Azure Container Registry, and Azure Container Instances.
The Tetris game app is built using HTML and JavaScript, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
The local development environment is set up for testing and fine-tuning the app.
A Linux Virtual Machine is created, and Docker engine is installed and configured on it.
The project utilizes Docker to pull the Nginx image and creates a Dockerfile for customization.
Azure Container Registry is established to store the Docker image securely.
The final step involves deploying a container instance using the Azure Container Registry image.

<h2>Description</h2>

The project begins by developing a Tetris game app using HTML and JavaScript, providing an engaging and interactive experience for users. The game is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across different devices. To ensure seamless deployment and management, Docker technology is leveraged.

Local development starts by running the Tetris game app on the developer's machine for testing and development. To make the deployment process more robust, a Linux Virtual Machine is created within Azure, where Docker is installed and configured. This VM acts as a secure and controlled environment for running the app.

A Docker image for Nginx is pulled, and a Dockerfile is created to customize the environment. This allows for the Tetris game to be served through a web server. Azure Container Registry is set up to store the Docker image securely, providing version control and access management.

The Azure CLI is installed for easy interaction with Azure services, and a Docker image is built using the Dockerfile. The image is then pushed to Azure Container Registry, ensuring that it is available for deployment in Azure Container Instances.
